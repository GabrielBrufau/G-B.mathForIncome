    <p>sets</p>
    <p>how can write symbolically that an element n belongs to set A?<br>
        <br>
    n &#8712 A <br>
    <br>
    how do you read it m &#8712 A? <br>
    <br>
    m no pertenece a  <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>sometimes we'll work whit various sets whose elements all belong to a langer set, which we'll call
        <br>
    a referencing or universal set, okey how we're going to symblize it?
    <br>
    <br>
    &#8746 ?
    <br>
    how we're going to now if a set is determined by extension or understanding? <br>
    extension(A) = {a,e,i,o,u}; <br>
    understanding(B) = {x : x is a member of the argentina's delegation} <br>
    <br>
    we could compare this with objects in javascript <br>
   
    look at this <br>
    <img src="img/00.png" alt=""> <br>

    this is an object iin javascript, where its elements are called properties <br>
    this could be an object created by extension as we say unambiguously that elements belong to the object <br>
    <img src="img/01.png" alt=""> <br>
    this image responds to a set determined by understanding
    <br>
    Venn Diagrams

    <br>
    let's now consider the sets <br>
    <br>
    F = {1,2,3,4,5,6} y H = {3,4,5}; <br>
    as we see all the elements of H are also elements of F <br>
    we'll denote it H &#8834; F and you read H conten or subset of F <br>
    in javascrip we could and it's just my umilde opinion to imagine an H object contained in an F object <br>
    F = {a:1,b:2,H,f:6}  H={c:3,d:4,e:5} <br>
    keep this in mind you could say that F is H's FaTher; <br>
    open your browser console and practice a 5min like creating the F and H object <br>
    noe think another 2 min as you would if you were a machine to traverse the object and realize that the value of H <br>
    are equal to those of F <br>
    if after those two minutes you have no idea what I'm talking aboutor how to <br>
    do it. perfect you're human you learn by copying don't try to discover something <br>
    someting that someone has take so long to discover and make available for us to move fast <br>
    now let's to try to make a compromise using a venn Diagram in a paper sketch <br>
        <br>
    being L = {a:1,b:2,c:3,d:4,f:5,g:6}, A={a:1,C:3}, and B={f:5,g:6,h:7} <br>
    <br>
    A is subset of L? <br>
    L is subset of A? <br>
    B is subset of L? <br>
    L is subset of B? <br>
    B is subset of B? <br>
    <br>
    now I'll give you a method that uses the machine and tries to do it on console for 15 min <br>
