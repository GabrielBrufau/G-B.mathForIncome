    <p>sets</p>
    <p>how can write symbolically that an element n belongs to set A?<br>
        <br>
    n &#8712 A <br>
    <br>
    how do you read it m &#8712 A? <br>
    <br>
    m no pertenece a  <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>sometimes we'll work whit various sets whose elements all belong to a langer set, which we'll call
        <br>
    a referencing or universal set, okey how we're going to symblize it?
    <br>
    <br>
    &#8746 ?
    <br>
    how we're going to now if a set is determined by extension or understanding? <br>
    extension(A) = {a,e,i,o,u}; <br>
    understanding(B) = {x : x is a member of the argentina's delegation} <br>
    <br>
    we could compare this with objects in javascript <br>
   
    look at this <br>
    <img src="img/00.png" alt=""> <br>

    this is an object iin javascript, where its elements are called properties <br>
    this could be an object created by extension as we say unambiguously that elements belong to the object <br>
    <img src="img/01.png" alt=""> <br>
    this image responds to a set determined by understanding

    let's now consider the sets <br>
    <br>
    F = {1,2,3,4,5,6} y H = {3,4,5}; <br>
    as we see all the elements of H are also elements of F <br>
    we'll denote it H &#8834; F and you read H conten or subset of F
