    <p>sets</p>
    <p>how can write symbolically that an element n belongs to set A?<br>
        <br>
    n &#8712 A <br>
    <br>
    how do you read it m &#8712 A? <br>
    <br>
    m no pertenece a  <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>sometimes we'll work whit various sets whose elements all belong to a langer set, which we'll call
        <br>
    a referencing or universal set, okey how we're going to symblize it?
    <br>
    <br>
    &#8746 ?
    <br>
    how we're going to now if a set is determined by extension or understanding?</p>
